# TEST RUNNER
#
# This script will run all of the files in the `tests/` directory who's name
# starts with `test` and ends with `.sh`. If a file named `setup.sh` is present
# in the `tests/` directory it will be run *before* each test. If a file named
# `teardown.sh` is present in the `tests/` directory it will be run *after* each
# test.
#
# If a test fails, the test runner will abort, rather than running all tests.
